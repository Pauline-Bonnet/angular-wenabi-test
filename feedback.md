# Feedback

Thank you for taking the test, we are very happy that you dedicate some time for Wenabi ðŸ’›.

**_How many hours did you work on this mini project ?_**

-> About ten

## You have something else to say ?
-> I would like to precise that this project was dvelopped using mobile-first solution. Plus, I didn't do a pixel perfect work, because I prefered use values that were more coherent with the font I used for the project. 
-> Secondly, I add a button to be able to get the whole list back, after filtering by status, because this was not planned on the mockups. This button is visible only after a filtering.

Before submitting your final work, tell us what you think about these different topics:

**Note**: It is totally **OK** for you to not have any feedback. We simply wanted to give a space for anyone who feels that this process can be improved and we are happy to hear it. Also, there are no right/wrong answers !

**_1 - How do you feel about the workload that was necessary to complete the mini project ? Would you say it was too much or too little ?_**

-> It is too little if we want to add tests (thing that I wish I could do, but would most likely do in a near future, as a personal capacity)

**_2 - How would you change this exam and/or examination process?_**
